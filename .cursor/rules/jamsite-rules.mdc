# Your rule content

This project is a website that displays a searchable list of songs (artist, title, and year) and the user can tap a song to view the chord sheet of the song (as PDF).

The site is statically generated using the jamsite.py python script. The database of song metadata is stored in Google Sheets and the song PDFs themselves are stored in either Google Drive or Dropbox.

The javascript for this site takes the "no framework" approach.

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to
