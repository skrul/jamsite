# Your rule content

This project is a website that displays a searchable list of songs (artist, title, and year) and the user can tap a song to view the chord sheet of the song (as PDF).

The site is statically generated using the jamsite.py python script. The database of song metadata is stored in Google Sheets and the song PDFs themselves are stored in either Google Drive or Dropbox.

The javascript for this site takes the "no framework" approach.

The source code for the site is in the "jamsite" directory. When the site is generated using the "poetry run jamsite --serve" command the output is put in the dist directory.


This site is built with a css framework called skeleton (see @http://getskeleton.com/ ) which uses a columular css layout. Please consider this when making any changes to the CSS or HTML.
